### Project Description
AnxiEase is a browser extension that helps with anxiety by prompting grounding questions and breathing exercises. The goal is to provide users with tools to manage anxiety through interactive activities.

### The Problem Statement
Anxiety can be overwhelming, and people often struggle with finding effective ways to manage it. How can we offer quick and simple tools that are accessible directly from your browser to help you stay calm and grounded?

### The Solution
AnxiEase helps users manage anxiety by offering grounding questions and breathing exercises. The extension provides an engaging experience where users can check in with themselves, answer questions, and participate in calming exercises. It even rewards you with badges for your participation!
